# External Query
Proof of Concept block for creating a query loop from an external source.

Built using the [WordPress Create Block Script](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/create-block).

To get up and running, pull this block into your WordPress plugins directory, `cd` into the block and run the following script:

`npm run build`

This will compile the assets into the build folder.

Before adding this block to a page ensure the following plugins have all been compiled and activated:

- [External Query](https://github.com/mattwatsoncodes/external-query/)
- [External Template](https://github.com/mattwatsoncodes/external-template)
